# Payload Encryption

This section provides 3 ways to implement encryption to your payload. With encryption, our payload can be harder for security solutions to detect, so we can evade the defenders more easily.

Subdirectories:

- `XOR` – simple XOR based encoding.
- `RC4` – uses the RC4 stream cipher.
- `AES` – multiple AES implementations.

## Tool
