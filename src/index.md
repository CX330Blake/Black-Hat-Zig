## Intro

> This project is continuously updating!

This project provides many malware techniques implementation using Zig since I'm a huge fan of it. You can use this repo to weaponize Zig. Black-Hat-Zig is continuously updating to make sure it contains as more content as it could. It will be perfect if you want to create a PR for this project.

Okay, let's hack the planet!

## Why Zig?

- 🤝 Easy to interact with C/C++ source
- 🔎 It's newer, so it's harder to be detect
- 💪 Strongly low level control, even lower than C
- 😱 It's harder to RE because of the modern compiler
- 🛡️ Minimal runtime dependencies - No massive standard library footprint
- 🎯 No undefined behavior - Explicit handling of edge cases prevents crashes

## Contributors

This project is mainly maintained & managed by [@CX330Blake](https://github.com/CX330Blake). PRs are welcomed. Hope there's more people use Zig for malware developing so the ecosystem will be more mature.

Huge thanks for these contributors!
