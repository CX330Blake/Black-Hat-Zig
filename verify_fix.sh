echo "3. Key changes made:"
echo "   - Changed hProcess from ?windows.HANDLE to windows.HANDLE"
echo "   - Initialized with @ptrFromInt(0) instead of null"
echo "   - Updated null checks from optional unwrapping to pointer comparison"
echo "   - Updated all usage sites to work with non-optional handle"

echo "4. Files modified:"
echo "   - src/main.zig: Main file with the compilation error fix"
echo "   - build.zig: Build configuration for testing"
echo "   - FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md: Documentation of the fix"
