# Payload Obfuscation

Techniques for disguising payload data. Each subfolder contains code for a specific type of obfuscation such as IP or MAC address manipulation.

Subdirectories:

- `IP-Address-Obfuscation` – hide IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
- `MAC-Address-Obfuscation` – manipulate MAC addresses.
- `UUID-Obfuscation` – encode and decode UUID values.
